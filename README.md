Frontend Contributor Guide
Welcome to the team! This repository is for the National Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. To ensure our UI is consistent and our code remains clean, please follow this guide for every task.

🚀 1. Getting Started
Before you start your first task, set up your local environment:

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/effileo/healthnet-frontend.git

Enter the folder: cd healthnet-frontend

Install dependencies: npm install

Start the app: npm start

🛠 2. The Development Workflow (Branches)
NEVER push directly to the main branch. Follow these steps for every feature:

Update your local code: Always start by pulling the latest changes:

Bash

git pull origin main
Create a new branch: Name your branch based on your task:

Bash

# Syntax: git checkout -b feature/[your-task-name]
git checkout -b feature/doctor-search-ui
Work on your Task: Only edit the files in your assigned folder (see the "Assignments" section below).

📬 3. How to Submit a Pull Request (PR)
Once you have finished your UI task:

Stage and Commit:

Bash

git add .
git commit -m "UI: Added [Name of Component] with medical styling"
Push to GitHub:

Bash

git push origin feature/[your-task-name]
Create the PR: * Go to the GitHub repository page.

You will see a yellow bar saying "Compare & pull request." Click it.

Add a description of what you built.

Wait for the Lead Architect (Admin) to review and merge your code.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
